Web-Development-Resources
=========================

I use this repository for compiling lists of free-and-open-source resources for my webdesign students.




## Goals

The aim is to provide an organized list of apropos FOSS resources, for getting beginning and novice web-developers's sites on their feet.

## Usage

The first sequence [01-Tutorial-Website-Creation-Workflows](01-Tutorial-Website-Creation-Workflows) aims to provide all the tools for creating a professional business site or blog.

The second sequence (in development) will show how to optimize your site and SEO once it is created.
