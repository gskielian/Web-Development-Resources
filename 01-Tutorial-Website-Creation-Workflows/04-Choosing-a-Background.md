========================

### Just Starting?

Then choose http://subtlepatterns.com/

...or use the standard css-approach

### Details 

* For simplicity and generalizability (using for all your pages) you may want to start with http://subtlepatterns.com/ 
* If you desire a image background (which is scalable) then use http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/
  * Backstretch.js is great for pages with semi-transparent div-blocks -- the backstretch's website is a perfect example.
